My CV.

Choose target for pandoc by running:

```
./target TARGET
```

which will set the target in the Makefile, i.e. converts from `src/TARGET.md` to `build/TARGET.pdf`, for example. Produce the CV in the specified output format using `make`:

```
make [ pdf | tex | gfm | readme | native ]
```

`pdf` is the default option. Choose `readme` to update this README file.

## Programming experience

**2<sup>nd</sup> year Engineering Robot Project** \| 2021 \| Arduino C++
\| *github.com/pylasnier/idp205*

- Lead software component of six-person team group project to design an
  autonomous robot;
- Task involved navigation within an arena to search and collect small
  dummies;
- Developed an understanding for the limitations of microcontrollers and
  how to work around them, especially in memory;
- Learnt alternatives for debugging a microcontroller system when
  breakpoints, watches, and other debugging features are not available.

**A-Level Computer Science NEA** \| 2019 — 2020 \| C# \|
*github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio*

- Designed a very simple, strongly-typed, pure functional programming
  language, which included some basic functional programming features:
  - functions as first-class citizens,
  - higher-order functions,
  - selection and recursion,
  - a basic type system including integers, floats, and bools (no arrays
    or monads);
- Developed an intermediate representation (IR) that implements this
  language;
- Built a translator, including a tokeniser and a parser that produce
  the described IR, featuring a rich error system including type
  checking;
- Packaged the whole interpreter with a simple IDE built using Windows
  Forms.
