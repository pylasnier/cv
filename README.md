My CV.

Choose target for pandoc by running:

```
./target TARGET
```

which will set the target in the Makefile, i.e. converts from `src/TARGET.md` to `build/TARGET.pdf`, for example. Produce the CV in the specified output format using `make`:

```
make [ all | pdf | tex | gfm | readme | native ]
```

`all` is the default option. Choose `readme` to update this README file.

## Professional experience

**Siemens Cambridge Software Internship** \| 2023 \| C++, Rust (WASM),
TypeScript

- 12-week summer internship at Cambridge office;
- Contributed to Siemens NX C++ codebase;
- Worked with dev tools team:
  - Wrote VSCode extensions to integrate with source control;
  - Implemented asynchronous client-server system in Rust using
    WebSockets.

## Project experience

**4<sup>th</sup> year Engineering Project** \| 2023 – 2024 \| Python

- Individual project for MEng;
- Achieved First Class;
- Modelling of 1-D thermoacoustics networks:
  - Mathematical analysis of complex thermodynamics problem;
  - Involves constructing system as linear algebra problem using finite
    differences;
  - Implemented as Python API to generate solutions from thermoacoustic
    configuration and assumed partial solution.

**2<sup>nd</sup> year Engineering Robot Project** \| 2021 \| Arduino C++
\| [*github.com/pylasnier/idp205*](https://github.com/pylasnier/idp205)

- Software lead of six-person team group project to design an autonomous
  robot;
- Task involved navigation within an arena to search and collect small
  dummies;
- Developed an understanding of the limitations of microcontrollers and
  how to work around them, especially memory constraints;
- Learnt alternatives for debugging a microcontroller system when
  breakpoints, watches, and other debugging features are not available.

**A-Level Computer Science NEA** \| 2019 – 2020 \| C# \|
[*github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio*](https://github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio)

- Designed an explicitly simply typed pure functional programming
  language, featuring:
  - functions as first-class citizens and higher-order functions,
  - selection and recursion,
  - a basic type system including integers, floats, and bools (arrays
    are possible as indexing functions, but no polymorphism or type
    constructors other than function types);
- Developed an intermediate representation (IR) that implements this
  language;
- Built a translator, including a tokeniser and a parser that produce
  the described IR, featuring a rich error system including type
  checking;
- Packaged the whole interpreter with a simple IDE built using Windows
  Forms.

## Extra-curricular experience

**St. Catharine’s College Badminton Club Captain** \| 2023 – 2024

- Ensured smooth-running of regular college training sessions;
- Fostered inclusive and competitive environment for players to develop
  and grow;

  - Managed club budget ensuring responsible consumption and spending on
    shuttles and restrings;
  - Organised weekly fixtures for intercollegiate league and tournament
    matches;
- Oversaw success of the college team in intercollegiate competitions:
  - Maintanence of high league division (2<sup>nd</sup> of 7) with an
    almost entirely fresh roster of players;
  - High placements in the annual team elimination doubles tournament
    (Cuppers) – semi-finals in the mixed discipline, and champions in
    the women’s discipline.
