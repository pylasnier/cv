# Professional experience

## **Siemens Cambridge Software Internship** | 2023 | C++, Rust (WASM), TypeScript

- 12-week summer internship at Cambridge office;
- Contributed to Siemens NX C++ codebase;
- Worked with dev tools team:
    - Wrote VSCode extensions to integrate with source control;
    - Implemented asynchronous client-server system in Rust using WebSockets.

# Project experience

## **4^th^ year Engineering Project** | 2023 -- 2024 | Python

- Individual project for MEng;
- Achieved First Class;
- Modelling of 1-D thermoacoustics networks:
    - Mathematical analysis of complex thermodynamics problem;
    - Involves constructing system as linear algebra problem using finite differences;
    - Implemented as Python API to generate solutions from thermoacoustic configuration and assumed partial solution.

## **A-Level Computer Science NEA** | 2019 -- 2020 | C# | [*github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio*](https://github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio)

- Designed an explicitly simply typed pure functional programming language, featuring:
    - functions as first-class citizens and higher-order functions,
    - selection and recursion,
    - a basic type system including integers, floats, and bools (arrays are possible as indexing functions, but no polymorphism or type constructors other than function types);
- Developed an intermediate representation (IR) that implements this language;
- Built a translator, including a tokeniser and a parser that produce the described IR, featuring a rich error system including type checking;
- Packaged the whole interpreter with a simple IDE built using Windows Forms.
