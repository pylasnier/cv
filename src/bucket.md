# Programming experience

**2^nd^ year Engineering Robot Project** | 2021 | Arduino C++ | *github.com/pylasnier/idp205*

- Lead software component of six-person team group project to design an autonomous robot;
- Task involved navigation within an arena to search and collect small dummies;
- Developed an understanding for the limitations of microcontrollers and how to work around them, especially in memory;
- Learnt alternatives for debugging a microcontroller system when breakpoints, watches, and other debugging features are not available.

**A-Level Computer Science NEA** | 2019 --- 2020 | C# | *github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio*

- Designed a very simple, strongly-typed, pure functional programming language, which included some basic functional programming features:
    - functions as first-class citizens,
    - higher-order functions,
    - selection and recursion,
    - a basic type system including integers, floats, and bools (no arrays or monads);
- Developed an intermediate representation (IR) that implements this language;
- Built a translator, including a tokeniser and a parser that produce the described IR, featuring a rich error system including type checking;
- Packaged the whole interpreter with a simple IDE built using Windows Forms.
