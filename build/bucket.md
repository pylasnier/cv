## Project experience

**4<sup>th</sup> year Engineering Project** \| 2023, ongoing \| Python

- Individual project for MEng;
- Modelling of 1-D thermoacoustics networks:
  - Ongoing design challenge involving thermodynamics problem;
  - Involves constructing system as linear algebra problem;
  - Using `numpy` Python library to solve system.

**2<sup>nd</sup> year Engineering Robot Project** \| 2021 \| Arduino C++
\| [*github.com/pylasnier/idp205*](https://github.com/pylasnier/idp205)

- Software lead of six-person team group project to design an autonomous
  robot;
- Task involved navigation within an arena to search and collect small
  dummies;
- Developed an understanding of the limitations of microcontrollers and
  how to work around them, especially memory constraints;
- Learnt alternatives for debugging a microcontroller system when
  breakpoints, watches, and other debugging features are not available.

**A-Level Computer Science NEA** \| 2019 – 2020 \| C# \|
[*github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio*](https://github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio)

- Designed an explicitly simply typed pure functional programming
  language, featuring:
  - functions as first-class citizens and higher-order functions,
  - selection and recursion,
  - a basic type system including integers, floats, and bools (arrays
    are possible as indexing functions, but no polymorphism or type
    constructors other than function types);
- Developed an intermediate representation (IR) that implements this
  language;
- Built a translator, including a tokeniser and a parser that produce
  the described IR, featuring a rich error system including type
  checking;
- Packaged the whole interpreter with a simple IDE built using Windows
  Forms.
