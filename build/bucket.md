## Programming experience

### **2<sup>nd</sup> year Engineering Robot Project** \| 2021 \| Arduino C++ \| [*github.com/pylasnier/idp205*](https://github.com/pylasnier/idp205)

- Lead software component of six-person team group project to design an
  autonomous robot;
- Task involved navigation within an arena to search and collect small
  dummies;
- Developed an understanding for the limitations of microcontrollers and
  how to work around them, especially in memory;
- Learnt alternatives for debugging a microcontroller system when
  breakpoints, watches, and other debugging features are not available.

### **A-Level Computer Science NEA** \| 2019 — 2020 \| C# \| [*github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio*](https://github.com/pylasnier/functional-studio)

- Designed an explicitly simply typed pure functional programming
  language, featuring:
  - functions as first-class citizens and higher-order functions,
  - selection and recursion,
  - a basic type system including integers, floats, and bools (arrays
    are possible as indexing functions, but no polymorphism or type
    constructors other than function types);
- Developed an intermediate representation (IR) that implements this
  language;
- Built a translator, including a tokeniser and a parser that produce
  the described IR, featuring a rich error system including type
  checking;
- Packaged the whole interpreter with a simple IDE built using Windows
  Forms.
